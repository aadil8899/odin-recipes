        <h2>What's In Carrot Cake?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sugars</b>: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li><b>Oil</b>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs</b>: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
            <li><b>Vanilla</b>: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
            <li><b>Leaveners</b>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li><b>Cinnamon</b>: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li><b>Salt</b>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li><b>Carrots</b>: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li><b>Pecans</b>: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
            <li><b>Butter</b> and <b>cream cheese</b>: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
        </ul>
